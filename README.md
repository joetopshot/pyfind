# pyfind
Python version of the *NIX find command

The original version of this file was created by Mihalis Tsoukalos
in an article called "Python: Write your own find" published in the 
May, 2017 issue of Linux Format magazine.

That version of the program worked nicely as is but didn't allow for
entering regular expressions for files and/or directories that were
being searched.
